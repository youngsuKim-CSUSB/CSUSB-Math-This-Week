This topics course aims to support upper-level undergraduate and graduate students interested in pursuing further study in mathematics.

We plan to present and discuss information about mathematics graduate school and the tools to succeed, with an emphasis on PhD-level work/programs. Tentative course activities include, but are not limited to, an in-depth investigation of mathematics content, locating resources, designing and delivering presentations, and leveraging peer support in the process.

Though the course will include activities related to the GRE and GRE subject exams, it is not a GRE preparation course.

Instructor consent is required to enroll in the course. Fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7XYoa7z_-1tkX46c2wOqtJwzrdDHxb845vZeeABjaMsWw0g/viewform?usp=sf_link) to contact the instructor -- expect a short in-person meeting.
