Dear Friends,

The Department of Mathematics invites you to join us in a celebration of the beautiful and well-loved life of our dear friend and colleague Peter Williams. We will gather at 5:30 PM on November 18, 2021 on the second floor of the Coyote Commons to share memories with one another and with Peter’s family. 

We are grateful for the support of the College of Arts and Letters for this event. Please RSVP by Friday, Nov. 12 to Diana De La Cruz <ddelacruz@csusb.edu>

Thank you,
Madeleine Jetter, Chair, Department of Mathematics
