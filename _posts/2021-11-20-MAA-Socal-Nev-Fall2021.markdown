We will virtually host the Fall 2021 MAA Socal-Nev Sectional meeting. Registration is free (but required to retrieve the Zoom link).

Thanks to the department, we recently purchased a MAA departmental membership. This would cover the majority of our students' membership. Stay tuned for more information.
