The Colorado State University Mathematics Department is excited to host a conference for underrepresented students in mathematics on April 14-16, 2023. 

Undergraduate and first-year graduate students from underrepresented groups (self-identified) are invited to participate in the conference and to present work on a research topic. There is no registration fee and pre-approved airfare and local expenses for the 14th â€“ 15th will be covered by conference funding (thank you College of Natural Sciences).  Space is limited and we can only accept a limited number of applications.
