The Graduate Program of Mathematics at the University of California, Riverside is hosting UCR's Math Graduate School Open House Saturday, November 19, 2022 from 10am-1pm. This is a great opportunity for prospective students to meet with faculty and graduate students in the department of Mathematics and inquire about our graduate program.

In addition to learning more about our Graduate Program in Mathematics, we will be providing a $50 graduate school application discount (applicable towards one Mathematics graduate program application for Fall 2023) to all of those who RSVP and attend.

Students may RSVP here

In addition to this email, attached is a flyer of our UCR Math Graduate School Open House event and our Applied Math Research. We are hopeful you may distribute this email and/or post our flyers within your department as it would help us to promote our event to your graduating students who are interested in applying to a graduate program in Mathematics for Fall 2023.
