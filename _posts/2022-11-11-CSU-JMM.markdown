From their [webpage](https://csu-jmm2022.com/): WELCOME TO THE FIRST CSU MATHEMATICAL CONFERENCE

The CSU Math Council is pleased to announce the first system-wide conference of mathematicians and statisticians from the twenty-three CSU campuses to meet, get to know each other, and talk about research. This meeting will be a showcase, and a means to disseminate, research work of CSU faculty and students from all mathematical and statistical disciplines. <!-- more -->

This meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for CSU faculty and students from different campuses with common interests to engage in long-term inter-campus collaborations, such as online research working groups, sabbaticals or other visits, and student exchanges.

The keynote talks on major topics of current interest, such as mathematical sciences, climate change, epidemiology, and data science, have the potential to stimulate discussions and new collaborations, as well as to attract more people to current active research fields in the CSU, with the possibility of increased funding.
