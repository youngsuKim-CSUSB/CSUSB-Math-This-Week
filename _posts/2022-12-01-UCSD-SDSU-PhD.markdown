Letter from the program co-director:

The MSED program is jointly operated by San Diego State University and UC, San Diego. We are reaching out to students in your department because we require a master’s degree in mathematics (pure, applied, or statistics), chemistry, biology, or physics for admission. Students can also enter with a “math heavy” math education masters (and then take additional math courses during the Ph.D. program). <!-- more -->

If you know of any students who are interested in a career as a mathematics education researcher, would you please forward this email to them with the additional information in the attachments? Or you can print the attachments as flyers for a department bulletin board. Our program web site is [www.sci.sdsu.edu/crmse/msed/](http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/crmse/msed/).
