You are invited to the 

**Online Undergraduate Resource Fair for the Advancement and Alliance of Marginalized Mathematicians (OURFA^2M^2)**, taking place via Zoom on November 19th & 20th, 2022.

The conference aims to help students gain resources and learn about opportunities to start or develop a math career (in research, teaching, or industry). Anyone is welcome to attend, and we are especially aimed at students from underrepresented and marginalized groups in mathematics.
 
This conference is for:

* undergraduate students at all levels, from students taking pre-calculus to upperclassmen
* students who want to learn about career-building opportunities and how to become a competitive applicant
* students who want to connect with peers and potential mentors

 
The event will include:
* panel discussions about various opportunities and programs for undergrads
* crash courses in areas of math common to undergraduate research 
* talks about mathematicians' journeys
* a resource presentation on conferences, mentorship, math organizations, etc.
networking lunches
