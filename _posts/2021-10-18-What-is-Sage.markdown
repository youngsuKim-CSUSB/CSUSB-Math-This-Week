Sage is an elegant and powerful programming language (built upon Python) that mathematicians use to explore, visualize, and compute.
Come join us as we walk you through a laid back introduction to using Sage in your mathematics courses. [Flyer]({{ '/assets/What-is-series/What-is-Sage-2021Fall.pdf' | relative_url }}) 

During the first 30 minutes, we will tell you what Sage is, how to get started using it, and many useful tips. This will be followed by some guided activities as you practice working with it on your own devices. No previous knowledge of Sage is required.
Ideally come prepared with access to a computer so you can practice along on the spot.

Hope to see you there!

Dr. Youngsu Kim, Dr. Bronson Lim, and Dr. Jeffrey S. Meyer
