      <!-- The Inland Empire Math Teachers’ Circle presents Dinner and a Math Problem! -->
<p>This monthly event offers the teaching community in the region a great opportunity to network and to work together to solve interesting and accessible mathematics problems. Each evening starts with dinner and some time to mingle, and then we get to the main course: the math problem! Our focus is to introduce you to problems that are accessible to all teachers from kindergarten through high school, yet are interesting and challenging enough to spend hours investigating. This is particularly relevant as we aim to engage our own students in creative mathematical thinking and equip them with the tools they need to problem solve and persevere.<br />
